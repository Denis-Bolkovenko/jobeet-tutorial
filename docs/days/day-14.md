# Jobeet Day 14: Translations

Yesterday, we finished the mailing feature by connecting external service.
Now, we will talk about Jobeet internationalization (or i18n) and localization (or l10n).

From [Wikipedia][3]:

> **Internationalization** is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.
>
> **Localization** is the process of adapting software for a specific region or language by adding locale-specific components and translating text.

## Configuration

Symfony comes with [translations][4] package out of the box. We don't have to install it.  
Also we have initial configuration in `config/packages/translation.yaml` file:

```yaml
framework:
    default_locale: '%locale%'
    translator:
        # ...
        fallbacks:
            - '%locale%'
```

Variable `%locale%` is defined in file `config/services.yaml` and value is `'en'`.
We can start with that configuration without any changes.

## Locale in the URL

The Jobeet website will be available in English and Russian.
As an URL can only represent a single resource, the culture must be embedded in the URL.
In order to do that, open the `config/routes/annotations.yaml` file, and add `prefix` for all routes (except API).

```yaml
controllers:
    resource: ../../src/Controller/
    type: annotation
    prefix:
        en: ''
        ru: '/ru'

api_controllers:
    # ...
```

Do the same change in `config/routes.yaml` for routes defined by FOSUserBundle:

```yaml
# ...

fos_user:
    resource: "@FOSUserBundle/Resources/config/routing/security.xml"
    prefix:
        en: ''
        ru: '/ru'
```

When the `prefix` with locale variable is used in a route, Symfony will automatically use its value.  
If you want to test that, then just add somewhere in `templates/base.html.twig` next code `{{ dump(app.request.locale) }}` and open homepage.
You will see `en` value, because it's configured as default locale.
Then open URL [http://127.0.0.1/ru/][5] and `ru` will be displayed.
That means symfony understands the locale from URL.

## Internationalization

...

```yaml
bin/console translation:update --dump-messages --output-format xlf --force en
```

## Final Thoughts

Internationalization and localization are first-class citizens in Symfony.
Providing a localized website to your users is very easy as symfony provides all the basic tools and even gives you command line tasks to make it fast.

Thatâ€™s all for today, you can find the code here: [https://github.com/gregurco/jobeet/tree/day14][1]
